# Grapes Disease Detection Using Deep Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting diseases in grape leaves using deep learning techniques.
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is trained on grape leaf images to classify
healthy and diseased plants.

## 🎯 Objective
- Detect grape leaf diseases automatically
- Reduce manual inspection in agriculture
- Support farmers with early disease identification

## 🧠 Diseases Covered
- Grape Black Rot
- Grape Esca (Black Measles)
- Grape Leaf Blight
- Healthy Grapes Leaf

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset consists of grape leaf images categorized into healthy and diseased classes.

Due to large size, the dataset is not uploaded to GitHub.

You can use any standard grape leaf dataset such as:

After downloading, extract the dataset and update the dataset path in the notebook.

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Install required libraries
2. Open the notebook
3. Run all cells sequentially

```bash
jupyter notebook GRAPES.ipynb
